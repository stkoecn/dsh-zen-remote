     - the subagent entry moved out of header.actions into the new
       conversation.session.header.lineage slot (inside the breadcrumb);
     - its root's class attribute is now "ZKlsPq_root " — with a TRAILING
       SPACE — so a [class$="_root"] anchor matches nothing at all;
     - the trigger only reacts to TRUSTED input: .click() and synthetic
       pointer/mouse events leave aria-expanded untouched (measured on device
       with every plugin override stripped), so forwarding a tap in JS can
       never open it again.

     The trigger's geometry is therefore owned at runtime by
     effects/native-trigger-overlay.ts, which lays the REAL button
     transparently over the activity pill — a genuine finger tap lands on the
     official element. Nothing in this stylesheet may size, hide, or set
     pointer-events on the trigger: that is exactly what would take the tap
     target away again.

     CSS keeps only two chores. Dissolve the root so its box (and its
     stray separator, hidden below) stops occupying the breadcrumb, and let
     the trigger participate from wherever the overlay pins it. And no menu
     re-anchoring anymore: the 0.1.1 popover portals to <body> as
     position:fixed and positions itself from the trigger's viewport rect
