     (real-device round 2, 2026-08-17; model pill reworked 2026-08-25:
     the user wants to SEE which model/effort is active, so only the
     permission trigger stays icon-only — its label is hidden and it
     collapses to a plain ~44x30 icon button. This AGREES with (rather than fights) the official
     container query (\`@container (width <= 460px) { .trigger:has(.triggerIcon)
     .triggerLabel { display: none } }\`) that S3 had to override — no need
     to override it back. Accessible name is unaffected: both official
     triggers already ship a descriptive aria-label independent of the
     visible text (PermissionSelect: t('input.accessMode', {name}); the
     model trigger: t('trigger.aria'/'trigger.ariaEffort')) — verified live
     in dsh-client-ui-conversation / dsh-client-ui-model-selection lib/
     client.js, 2026-08-17 — so hiding the label costs nothing for screen
     readers. The permission trigger only renders an icon for the
     "read-only" / "workspace-write" presets (permissionGlyphs in
     dsh-client-ui-conversation) — "Full access" and any host-configured
     preset name fall back to chevron-only, a known gap in the official
     markup this plugin cannot fill without inventing new icon meaning.
     The model trigger never renders an icon at all (only label + optional
     effort text + chevron), so its ::before below draws one from a
     primitives icon path (Sparkle — the closest existing "model" glyph) as
     a CSS-only pseudo-element: it survives React re-renders for free
     (unlike a DOM-injected node, which would need a MutationObserver, see
     the preview-full-toggle pitfall in AGENTS.md) and does not touch
     accessible-name computation (empty generated content). S3's

     - fade-IN under the header: the header's own ::after, restyled into a

     painted 26px tall (measured live, 2026-08-20). Give it the official

  /* --- 7c. the queue strip opts OUT of the cage, on a line of its own ---
     Third entry that is not a pill. conversation.input.dock is a \`list\` slot
     and DSH's own QueueDock registers into it at order 20 (id \`queue\`,
     dsh-client-ui-conversation) — a 36px row per queued message, or a
     collapsible "N 条排队消息" header once there is more than one. The 26px
     cage above clipped it to a sliver: on a phone a queued message showed as
     a grey stub poking out from behind the input card, unreadable and with
     its edit / delete / send buttons cut off (reported 2026-08-22, same
     failure the to-do card hit in 7a).

     Two things are restored. Geometry: the official row height back, and the
     dock's own composer-column sizing dropped — its width/max-width are
     calc()s over the composer card variables and its bottom margin is
     negative by design (upstream tucks the strip UNDER the card), none of
     which survives being a flex item of our chip rail.

     Layout — the line policy for the whole rail, now that three things want
     room on it. The pills (the to-do card, a branch chip, whatever else
     registers) keep order 0 and share the top line, still scrolling
     horizontally. The queue takes the next line (order 1). The attachment
     chips take the last one (order 2, 7b), so what the user is about to send
     sits closest to the input it will be sent from. The rail only wraps
     while one of the two full-width entries exists, so a session with
     neither keeps the original single scrolling chip line. */

     Owned HERE, not by the gateway half. That plugin used to carry
       [data-slot="conversation.composer"] { padding-bottom: max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom), 8px) }
     in both pwa/app.css and the gateway's inline DEVICE_CSS. Both were
     INERT and had always been: that slot element is \`display: contents\`
     (measured 2026-08-17 — the slot wrapper generates no box, so padding on
     it is discarded), which is why raising it never moved anything. The rule
     is deleted on the PWA side and restated here on an element that actually
     lays out, reading --mnav-sab so ?mobile-nav-inset=54,34 can regress it
     off-device (env() is hard 0 on desktop — the whole reason S2.1 exists).

     Target: the card should look EQUALLY inset on all four sides. This same
     element carries the card's side inset (\`padding: 0 16px\` officially,
     measured 16px left and 16px right at 390px), so the bottom gap is simply
     capped at that same 16px. Clearing the FULL 34px inset — the naive
     max(sab, 8px) — is what read as "too thick": it is more than double the
     side margin, so the card looked shoved up off the bottom edge.

     clamp() says all three requirements at once:
       - floor 8px  -> a device with no home indicator (sab: 0) keeps the
                       official 8px exactly, so this is a strict no-op there;
       - track sab  -> a shallower inset than 16px is honoured as-is;
       - cap 16px   -> a full-size indicator (sab: 34) lands on 16px, equal
                       to the side inset, which is the look being asked for.
     Keep the 16px in step with the side padding above if that ever changes;
     that equality IS the spec here, not a coincidence. */
