 * The shell deliberately relies on the browser's own focus-reveal behaviour
 * (home.css.ts: plain overflow:hidden so iOS pans the visual viewport, no
 * visualViewport JS). Issue #1 (小米 + 微信输入法) showed one environment
 * where that chain can break while the viewport still shrinks. This effect
 * is the increment that covers it: mirror the occluded band into a root CSS
 * variable, and let the stylesheet translate the composer up by it. In every
 * environment where the browser already handles the keyboard the band
 * computes to zero and nothing changes.
 *
 * `scroll` is listened to as well as `resize`: panning the visual viewport
 * changes offsetTop without a resize (CSSOM View §13.2), and both sides of
 * the subtraction must stay fresh.
 *
 * Second layer (2026-08-21, after on-device confirmation): the reporter's
 * 小米 + 微信输入法 keyboard is INVISIBLE to Chrome — vv.height stayed 859/858
 * with the keyboard open, so no event ever fires and the geometry above is
 * honestly zero. For that class only, a touch-granted composer focus starts a
 * short probe; if the viewport has not moved at all by the end, the composer
 * gets an ESTIMATED lift until blur. Guards against false positives:
 * - probe only after a recent touch pointerdown (a hardware-keyboard focus
 *   never lifts anything);
 * - any viewport movement ≥ {@link PROBE_EPSILON_PX} cancels the probe — a
 *   browser that shows any reaction owns the reveal itself (iOS pans,
 *   working Android resizes);
 * - a non-zero geometric lift always wins over the estimate.
 *
 * Third layer: an IME that under-reports its height (toolbar strip left out
 * of what it declares) makes the browser shrink the viewport by less than the
 * keyboard covers — every number the page can read is self-consistent, so no
 * occlusion is computable. Whenever a keyboard is up and the browser DID
 * react, the composer therefore also gets {@link safetyPad} of clearance —
 * Android only, where the under-reporting happens.
 * See {@link composerLift} for how the three sources compose.
