/**
 * Is the slot holding anything that actually costs the row width?

 * The row is one nowrap flex line whose only elastic item is the model pill
 * (composer.css.ts section 1), so entries here are paid for out of the model
 * name. But that is only a problem once something WIDE lands in the slot —
 * today dsh-plugin-subscriptions' speed chip, which renders "速度 · 标准" and
 * eats ~70px. dsh-vision-router's toggle alone is a 28px icon that the row
 * accommodates fine, and moving it on its own would cost a tap (it becomes
 * two: open the sheet, then toggle) to buy width nobody needed.
 *
 * So: relocate only when the slot holds an entry that is not the vision
 * toggle. With no such entry — subscriptions not installed, or installed but
 * not contributing on this model — nothing moves and the row keeps its one
 * icon, which is the behaviour asked for (user review, 2026-09-06).
 *
 * Why this rather than sniffing for subscriptions by name: the slot system
 * adds no per-registration marker (measured — entries render straight into the
 * container) and subscriptions marks nothing of its own, so naming it would
 * mean adding a marker to our fork of that plugin and anchoring on it. That
 * marker dies the day the fork is dropped, and the feature would go quiet
 * with nothing to catch it. The width question is the real question anyway,
 * and this asks it directly.

/**
 * Phone: park the composer row's third-party controls inside the model sheet.
 *
 * With the speed chip and the vision toggle both present on a GPT model the
 * row runs out of width. Both are model-scoped settings, so the model sheet —
 * which already holds 模型 and 推理等级 — is where they belong (user request,
 * 2026-09-06).
 *
 * Why move the real controls instead of drawing our own rows that drive them:
 * the same reason native-trigger-overlay.ts moves the real trigger. A stand-in
 * has to script the original, which is a road this plugin does not go down —
 * beyond the trusted-input wall that effect documents, our own rows would have
 * to mirror every piece of state (speed tier, disabled, aria-pressed, whether
 * a vision twin exists for the current model) and would rot on the next
 * upstream restyle. Moving the node keeps one source of truth: their React
 * roots go on owning and updating these elements, we only change where they
 * hang.
 *
 * Measured 2026-09-06 (DSH 0.1.2, 390px) before writing this — the two things
 * that would have killed the approach both hold: a relocated control survives
 * host re-renders (typing into the composer re-renders the row and does not
 * yank it back) and stays hit-testable at its new position.
 *
 * Restoring on close is not cosmetic. The sheet unmounts when it closes and
 * anything still inside goes with it, so the controls would vanish from the
 * page while their React roots kept updating detached nodes. The observer
 * therefore watches the menu leaving too, and the parked node is held as a
 * reference rather than looked up — once the menu is detached a document
 * query can no longer find it.
